# AERD_ALT_FC_V1

Rocket Flight Controller
Overview
This Arduino-based Rocket Flight Controller is designed to control and monitor the flight of a rocket. It incorporates an MPU6050 IMU sensor for orientation tracking, a BMP180 sensor for altitude measurements, GPS for location tracking, and LoRa communication for remote control and telemetry. The controller can perform IMU calibration, log sensor data to an SD card, transmit data via LoRa, and deploy a parachute at a specified altitude.

Usage
Calibrating MPU6050
Before launching the rocket, you should calibrate the MPU6050 for accurate orientation tracking. To start the calibration process:

Power on the rocket flight controller.
Send a calibration command over the serial connection or LoRa communication to initiate calibration.
Follow the on-screen instructions to place the MPU6050 on a flat, stable surface. Ensure it remains stationary during calibration.
Wait for the calibration process to complete.
Remote Control via LoRa
You can send commands to the rocket flight controller over LoRa to perform actions like initiating calibration or pre-launch checks. Refer to the communication protocol for details on the commands and responses.

Data Logging
The controller can log sensor data, including pitch, roll, yaw, altitude, latitude, and longitude, to an SD card. Data is saved in CSV format, and you can access it after the flight.
